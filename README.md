# State-of-Iowa-Employee-Pay-Prediction
This project inspects employee salary data from the State of Iowa database retrieved online from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/state-of-iowa-salary-book. The data includes more than 500,000 entries giving the gender, job title,  department, city of residence, pay, and travel expenses for each employee from  2007 to 2017, inclusive. The database does not give employee age or tenure in  the current position or length of employment with the State. The goal of this  project is to infer hourly pay for employees based on the available  predictors, realizing there may still be substantial variation due to variables not available in the data set. Annual salaries were not predicted since many employees likely only received salary for part of each year. Linear regression and random forest regression is used to fit models to training data.
